# GIPHY-API
An app that pulls GIF's from the GIPHY API and displays them on a webpage

I pre-loaded a few buttons to onto the page and when selected it will make an API call to giphy and display the gifs searched onto the page. The user can add additional buttons my manually typing a search parameter in the search bar. This will create a new button that can be pressed and display data on the page.

This app demonstrates my ability to handle API calls as well as generating content dynamically onto the webpage.

Have fun!
